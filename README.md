# Natural-Language-Process---2022

This repository will be utilized for taking of NLP course during the first quarter of 2022. This course was recommended by my professor at Syracuse as a continuation of the course taken during my master degree studies.

Here I will post projects and smaller assignments completed during the course as a public display of my growing portfolio of work.
